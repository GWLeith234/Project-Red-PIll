# Sprint: Podcast & Show Page Branding Redesign

## Replit Prompt — Copy and paste this entire block

```
Redesign the podcast show pages and browse/listen grid to give each show a premium, Spotify-style branded experience with bold full-bleed hero images and strong personal brand identity.

---

PART A — AI-GENERATED HERO IMAGES PER SHOW:

(1) Add two new columns to the podcasts table (or shows table — check the schema):
- hero_image_url: text, nullable — full-bleed hero background image URL
- accent_color: text, nullable — hex color extracted or assigned per show (e.g. "#1DB954")
- host_image_url: text, nullable — host/talent photo URL

(2) For each existing podcast in the database, generate a hero image using the existing AI image generation system (check ai-providers.ts for image generation capability). If image generation is not available, use a curated set of high-quality royalty-free placeholder images from Unsplash with relevant themes:

Use these Unsplash source URLs as hero images (assign one per show based on the show's topic):
- Political/News show: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589829085413-56de8ae18c73?w=1600 (microphone, dark studio)
- Conservative commentary: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529107386315-e1a2ed48a620?w=1600 (American flag, dramatic)
- Talk/Interview: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1478737270239-2f02b77fc618?w=1600 (podcast studio)
- Business/Finance: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611532736597-de2d4265fba3?w=1600 (dark modern studio)
- General fallback: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590602847861-f357a9332bbc?w=1600 (dramatic microphone)

Assign accent colors per show — cycle through this palette:
#C0392B (bold red), #2980B9 (strong blue), #8E44AD (deep purple), #E67E22 (burnt orange), #27AE60 (forest green), #2C3E50 (dark navy)

Store these values in the database for each podcast.

PART B — INDIVIDUAL SHOW PAGE REDESIGN:

(3) Redesign the individual podcast/show page (the page at /listen/:slug or /shows/:slug — check the routing):

HERO SECTION (full viewport width, ~70vh tall):
- Full-bleed background: the show's hero_image_url as a background-image with background-size: cover, background-position: center
- Dark gradient overlay: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.85) 100%) so text is always readable
- Content positioned at bottom-left of hero (like Spotify album pages):
  - "PODCAST" label in small caps, muted white, letter-spaced
  - Show title in massive bold white text (4xl-6xl depending on title length)
  - Host name with a small avatar/icon if host_image_url exists
  - Short show description (2 lines max, white, 80% opacity)
  - Two buttons side by side: 
    - Primary "Subscribe" button (filled, accent_color background)
    - Secondary "Latest Episode ▶" button (outlined, white border)
  - Episode count and frequency badge (e.g. "Weekly • 247 episodes")
- Show artwork (the square podcast cover art) positioned bottom-right of hero, ~180px, with subtle drop shadow, slightly overlapping the hero bottom edge

STATS BAR (just below hero, dark background):
- Horizontal row of 3-4 stats: Total Episodes, Subscribers, Avg Duration, Latest Episode date
- Clean numbers with muted labels, separated by vertical dividers

EPISODES SECTION:
- Section header: "Latest Episodes" with "View All" link
- Episode list: each episode as a horizontal row card containing:
  - Episode number (small, muted)
  - Thumbnail (square, 60px, rounded)
  - Episode title (bold, 1 line truncated)
  - Description (2 lines, muted, smaller)
  - Duration badge
  - Publish date (relative: "3 days ago")
  - Play button (circular, accent_color, right side)
- Show 10 episodes by default with a "Load More" button
- Alternate row backgrounds slightly for readability

ABOUT SECTION:
- Full show description
- Host bio if available
- Category tags
- Subscribe/follow links (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, RSS placeholders)

(4) Make the hero fully responsive:
- Mobile: hero height 50vh, title font size scales down, buttons stack vertically, artwork hidden on very small screens
- Tablet: hero height 60vh
- Desktop: hero height 70vh, full layout as described

---

PART C — BROWSE/LISTEN GRID REDESIGN:

(5) Redesign the podcast browse/listen grid page (/listen or /shows):

PAGE HERO:
- Simple dark header with "Shows & Podcasts" title and a search input
- Subtitle: "Subscribe to your favorite conservative voices"

SHOW CARDS (replace current card design):
Each card should feel like a premium streaming platform card:
- Card dimensions: ~280px wide, ~360px tall (portrait aspect ratio)
- Top 60% of card: hero_image_url as full-bleed background with dark gradient from bottom
- Bottom 40%: dark card background containing:
  - Show title (bold, white, 2 lines max)
  - Host name (smaller, muted)
  - Episode count badge + frequency (e.g. "Weekly")
  - Short description (2 lines, muted, very small)
  - Accent color left border strip (4px, the show's accent_color)
- On hover: 
  - Card scales up slightly (transform: scale(1.03))
  - A "▶ Latest Episode" button fades in over the hero image area
  - Subtle glow effect using the show's accent_color
- Card links to the individual show page

GRID LAYOUT:
- Desktop: 4 columns
- Tablet: 2-3 columns  
- Mobile: 2 columns (compact cards) or 1 column (full width)
- Gap between cards: 20px
- Cards sorted by: subscriber count desc by default

FEATURED SHOW (optional — if a show is marked as featured):
- First slot is a wide "featured" card spanning 2 columns
- Same design but landscape orientation with larger text

---

PART D — ADMIN: SHOW BRANDING PANEL:

(6) In the admin area where podcasts are managed (check existing podcast admin page), add a "Branding" section to each podcast's edit form:
- Hero Image URL input (with preview thumbnail)
- Host Image URL input (with preview)
- Accent Color picker (color input type="color" + hex text input)
- "Regenerate Hero" button that re-assigns an Unsplash hero based on show category
- Preview button that opens the show page in a new tab

(7) Add these fields to the podcast PATCH endpoint so they can be saved.
