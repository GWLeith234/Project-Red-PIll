# Sprint: Admin UI Consistency — Fonts, Navigation, KPI Cards

## Replit Prompt — Copy and paste this entire block

```
Audit and enforce consistent UI standards across every admin page. This is a visual consistency pass — no new functionality, just making every page follow the same design pattern.

NOTE: Kanban Board and My Tasks have been removed from the platform. If they appear anywhere in sidebar config, navigation components, or quick link cards, remove them entirely.

---

THE STANDARD LAYOUT (enforce on every admin page):

Layer 1 — PAGE HEADER (top of content area):
- Left side: Lucide icon (in theme primary color) + Page title (bold, large)
- Right side: AI Action button (purple #6C3FC5, white text) immediately LEFT of Primary Action button (theme primary color, white text)
- Gap between AI and Primary buttons: 8px
- If no AI action: only Primary button shows on the right
- If no primary action (overview pages): no buttons
- Consistent height, padding, and alignment across ALL pages

Layer 2 — KPI STRIP (immediately below header):
- Horizontal row of small metric cards
- Each card: metric label (small, muted, uppercase), large number/value, trend indicator (↑↓ with % in green/red)
- Cards auto-size to fill full width equally
- Maximum 6 cards per strip
- Consistent card height (~80px), font sizes, and spacing across ALL pages
- If real data isn't available yet show 0 or N/A — never skip the strip entirely

Layer 3 — TAB STRIP (only on pages with multiple views):
- Active tab: primary color underline, bold text
- Inactive tabs: muted text, no underline
- Same height, padding, and font across ALL pages
- Sits flush below KPI strip with no extra gap

Layer 4 — WORK AREA:
- Main content below tabs (or below KPI strip if no tabs)
- Consistent card/table padding and border radius

TYPOGRAPHY — enforce these globally in admin CSS/theme:

- Page titles (h1): 24px, font-weight 700
- Section headers (h2): 18px, font-weight 600
- Tab labels: 14px, font-weight 500
- KPI metric values: 28px, font-weight 700
- KPI metric labels: 11px, font-weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em
- Table headers: 12px, font-weight 600, uppercase, muted color
- Table body: 14px, font-weight 400
- Button text: 14px, font-weight 500
- Body/description text: 14px, font-weight 400, line-height 1.5

Use the existing font family already set in the theme — do not change the font family, only enforce consistent sizing and weights.

---

SIDEBAR NAVIGATION — enforce these standards:

Section labels (COMMAND CENTER, CONTENT FACTORY, etc.):
- 11px, font-weight 600, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em, muted color

Nav items:
- 14px, font-weight 500
- Active: theme primary color text + 3px left border in primary color + slightly lighter background
- Inactive: muted text, transparent background
- Hover: slightly lighter background, text brightens
- Icon size: 16px, consistent vertical alignment with text
- Padding: 8px vertical, 16px horizontal

KPI CARDS — enforce these specific metrics per page:

Dashboard:
- Total Subscribers | Active Users Today | Content Published This Week | Revenue MTD | Push Delivery Rate | Avg Session Duration

Content Factory:
- Total Pieces | Published | In Moderation | Drafts | AI Generated | Avg Time to Publish

Advertising:
- Active Sponsorships | Revenue MTD | Total Impressions | Total Clicks | Avg CTR | QR Scans

Network / CRM:
- New Leads | Active Proposals | Pipeline Value | Revenue MTD | At Risk Clients | Churned (30d)

Analytics:
- Live Visitors | Pageviews (30d) | Unique Visitors | Avg Session Duration | Bounce Rate | NPS Score

Community:
- Active Events | Open Polls | Total Votes | Community Posts Today | Flagged Posts | Active Users

Page Builder:
- Total Pages | Published | Drafts | Total Views | Avg Blocks Per Page | Last Published

Settings:
- Active Integrations | AI Tokens Used Today | Pages Published | Active Sponsorships | Team Members | System Uptime

Query real data where it exists. Show 0 or N/A where it doesn't. Never hide or skip the KPI strip.

PAGES TO AUDIT (fix every page that doesn't match the standard):

1. /admin/dashboard
2. /admin/content-factory
3. /admin/advertising
4. /admin/network
5. /admin/analytics
6. /admin/community
7. /admin/page-builder
8. /admin/settings

For each page verify and fix:
- [ ] PageHeader: icon + title left, AI button then Primary button right
- [ ] KPI strip present with correct 6 metrics for that page
- [ ] Tab strip consistent style if tabs exist
- [ ] Typography matches spec above
- [ ] Buttons correct colors, sizes, order
- [ ] No Kanban Board or My Tasks references anywhere

Use existing shared components (PageHeader, MetricsStrip, AIActionButton) throughout. Do not create new implementations of these components.

---

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Every admin page has the 3-layer layout: Header → KPI Strip → Work Area
2. KPI strip shows on every page with correct labels (0/N/A if no data)
3. All page titles same size and weight
4. AI button is always purple, always left of primary button
5. Primary button is always theme color, always rightmost
6. Sidebar contains correct pages in correct order — no Kanban Board, no My Tasks
7. Sidebar active state, hover state, and section labels all consistent
8. Tab strips look identical across all pages that have tabs
9. No page has its own custom title implementation — all use PageHeader component
