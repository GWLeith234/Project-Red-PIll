Build a persistent audio player for the audience-facing app that survives page navigation and supports background playback. Implementation:

(1) Create a React context AudioPlayerContext in client/src/components/AudioPlayerProvider.tsx. State: currentEpisode (object with id, title, podcastTitle, audioUrl, coverImage, duration), isPlaying, currentTime, duration, volume, playbackRate, queue (array of episodes). Functions: play(episode), pause(), resume(), seek(time), setVolume(v), setPlaybackRate(r), addToQueue(episode), playNext(), playPrevious(). Use a single HTML5 Audio element created with useRef. Attach timeupdate, ended, loadedmetadata, error event listeners.

(2) Integrate the Media Session API for lock-screen and notification controls. When an episode starts playing: navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({ title: episode.title, artist: episode.podcastTitle, album: 'MediaTech Empire', artwork: [{ src: episode.coverImage, sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png' }] }). Set action handlers for play, pause, seekbackward (skip back 15s), seekforward (skip forward 30s), previoustrack (playPrevious), nexttrack (playNext).

(3) Wrap AudienceLayout's children in AudioPlayerProvider in App.tsx so the context persists across all audience routes.

(4) Build the MiniPlayer component at client/src/components/MiniPlayer.tsx. This renders as a fixed bar above the bottom tab bar (bottom-14 on mobile, bottom-0 on desktop). Shows: episode cover image (40x40 rounded), episode title (truncated), podcast name (truncated), play/pause button, 15s skip-back button, 30s skip-forward button, and a thin progress bar at the top edge of the bar. Tapping the text area expands to a full-screen player modal with: large cover art, full title and podcast name, scrubber/seek bar with current time and duration, play/pause/skip buttons, volume slider, playback speed selector (0.5x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x), queue list, and a close/minimize button.

(5) Mount MiniPlayer inside AudienceLayout, below {children} and above the bottom tab bar. Only render when currentEpisode is not null. Adjust the bottom padding of <main> to account for the mini player height when visible (add pb-28 when player is active instead of pb-16).

(6) Connect the existing EpisodePage play buttons to AudioPlayerContext. When a user taps play on any episode, call play(episode) from context instead of using a page-local audio element. If EpisodePage currently has its own audio player, remove it and use the global one.
