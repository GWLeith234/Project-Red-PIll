# UI Consistency Fix — All Pages (Complete Pass)

## Replit Prompt — Copy and paste this entire block

```
Fix UI/UX standard violations across 9 admin pages. The Advertising page is the reference implementation — match it exactly. Do NOT change any data, logic, routing, or functionality. Structure and styling only.

THE STANDARD (non-negotiable):
1. PageHeader: [icon in primary color] [Page Title 24px bold white] ←left | right→ [AI Button: purple #6C3FC5, Sparkles icon, "AI [Action]"] [Primary Button: primary brand color, "+ [Action]"] — 8px gap between buttons
2. KPI Strip: 6 cards, auto-width, dark card background. Each card: label (11px uppercase muted, NO colored text), value (28px bold WHITE, NO colored text), trend indicator optional. Icons on KPI cards must be muted/white — NOT colored purple/green/blue
3. Tab strip (where applicable)
4. Main content

CRITICAL KPI STYLING RULE: KPI card values and icons must be white/muted. The colored values (purple "3", teal "100%", green "6") and colored icons seen on Push Campaigns, Newsletters, and Campaign Builder are WRONG. All values must be white. All icons must be the primary color or muted — never individual metric colors.

FIX 1 — DASHBOARD (/admin/dashboard):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT
- Has AI Insights button (purple) — CORRECT
- Missing primary action button
- Missing KPI strip entirely — goes straight to Live Activity Feed

Required fixes:
- Add primary button to PageHeader right side, left of AI button: "+ New Content" (primary color)
- Add KPI strip between PageHeader and the Live Activity Feed:
  6 cards: Total Subscribers | Content Published (this week) | Active Users Today | Revenue MTD | Push Delivery Rate | Avg Session Duration
  Pull real data where available, show 0 for empty state

---

FIX 2 — CONTENT FACTORY (/admin/content-factory):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT
- Has AI Generate button (purple) — CORRECT
- Missing primary action button entirely — no primary button visible
- KPI strip exists with 6 cards — CORRECT count
- KPI styling appears correct (white values) — check and confirm

Required fixes:
- Add primary button to PageHeader right side, right of AI Generate: "+ New Content" (primary color)
- Confirm KPI values are white not colored — fix if colored

---

FIX 3 — CAMPAIGN BUILDER (/admin/campaign-builder):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT
- Missing AI button entirely
- Missing primary action button (there should be one but it's not visible)
- KPI strip has only 4 cards — needs 6
- KPI icons are colored (purple, teal, etc.) — WRONG, must be white/muted
- KPI values appear colored — WRONG, must be white

Required fixes:
- Add AI button to PageHeader: purple #6C3FC5, "AI Generate" (left of primary button)
- Add primary button: "+ New Campaign" (primary color)
- Add 2 more KPI cards to reach 6: "Open Rate" and "Total Recipients"
- Fix all KPI icon colors → white or muted
- Fix all KPI value colors → white (#FFFFFF)

---

FIX 4 — AD RESIZER (/admin/ad-resizer):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT
- Missing AI button
- Missing primary action button
- Missing KPI strip entirely
- The tool itself (upload + platforms + resize panel) is the main content — this is correct, it's a tool not a data page

Required fixes:
- Add AI button to PageHeader: "AI Suggest" (purple) — clicking this could suggest optimal platform sizes based on the uploaded image dimensions
- Add primary button: "Resize All" (primary color) — triggers resize across all selected platforms
- Add KPI strip with 4 meaningful cards (this page has limited metrics so 4 is acceptable as a minimum):
  Formats Available | Last Resized | Total Downloads | Platforms Supported
  Show static/real values: "70" for Formats Available, "9" for Platforms Supported, pull real data for others

---

FIX 5 — NEWSLETTERS (/admin/newsletters):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT  
- Missing AI button
- Primary button "+ New Newsletter" exists but is positioned wrong (floating top right outside PageHeader)
- KPI strip has only 4 cards — needs 6
- KPI icons are colored (purple sparkle, purple document, blue arrow, purple clock) — WRONG
- KPI values are colored (purple "0", purple "4", white "0", white "4") — inconsistent, all must be white

Required fixes:
- Add AI button to PageHeader: "AI Generate" (purple), positioned LEFT of the primary button
- Move "+ New Newsletter" button INTO the PageHeader right-button group (it currently floats at top right but outside the standard header component)
- Add 2 more KPI cards to reach 6: "Total Subscribers" and "Avg Open Rate"
- Fix all KPI icon colors → white or muted
- Fix all KPI value colors → white (#FFFFFF) uniformly

---

FIX 6 — PUSH CAMPAIGNS (/admin/push-campaigns):

Current violations:
- Has PageHeader with icon + title — CORRECT
- Missing AI button
- Primary button "+ New Campaign" exists but floats outside PageHeader (top right, not in header component)
- KPI strip has 5 visible cards (6th is cut off) — needs to fit 6 properly
- KPI icons are colored (blue, purple, teal, green) — WRONG, must be white/muted
- KPI values are colored (white "3", white "3", teal "100%", white "6") — inconsistent, all must be white
- KPI cards are too wide/not auto-sizing to fit 6 across the full width

Required fixes:
- Add AI button to PageHeader: "AI Analyze" (purple), positioned LEFT of the primary button
- Move "+ New Campaign" INTO the PageHeader right-button group
- Fix KPI cards to auto-size so all 6 fit in one row without overflow:
  6 cards: Total Subscribers | Sent This Month | Avg Delivery Rate | Total Delivered | Clicks This Month | Click Rate
- Fix all KPI icon colors → white or muted
- Fix all KPI value colors → white (#FFFFFF) uniformly

---

FIX 7 — NETWORK (/admin/network):

Current violations:
- Title "Network" has icon — CORRECT
- Missing AI button and primary action button

Required fixes:
- Add PageHeader buttons: AI button "AI Suggest" (purple) + primary button "+ Add Lead" (primary color)
- Reorder layout: PageHeader → Tabs → KPI strip → pipeline boards
- Expand KPI strip to 6 cards: Total Leads | Pipeline Value | Closed Won | Pending AI Prompts | New This Week | Avg Deal Size
- Fix KPI card sizing so all 6 fit in one row

---

FIX 8 — AUDIENCE CRM (/admin/audience-crm):

Current violations:
- No PageHeader — page starts with floating "ADD SUBSCRIBER" button
- No KPI strip
- Tab strip (Subscribers/Campaigns) has no context above it
- Light sidebar / dark content theme mismatch

Required fixes:
- Add full PageHeader: Users icon (primary color) | "Audience CRM" | AI button "AI Segment" (purple) | primary button "+ Add Subscriber" (primary color)
- Remove the floating "ADD SUBSCRIBER" button — replaced by PageHeader primary button
- Add KPI strip (6 cards): Total Subscribers | New This Week | Active | At Risk | Avg Open Rate | Churn Rate
- Tab strip goes below KPI strip
- Fix sidebar theme: sidebar must use dark background matching content area (check CSS class on sidebar component and ensure it inherits the admin dark theme)

---

FIX 9 — SALES CRM (/admin/sales-crm):

Current violations:
- No PageHeader — page starts with tabs (Companies/Contacts/Deals/Campaigns) at very top
- No KPI strip  
- No title, no icon, no buttons

Required fixes:
- Add full PageHeader: Briefcase icon (primary color) | "Sales CRM" | AI button "AI Score" (purple) | primary button "+ Add Company" (primary color)
- Add KPI strip (6 cards): Total Companies | Active Deals | Pipeline Value | Closed Won MTD | New Leads | Avg Deal Size
- Tab strip goes below KPI strip
- Fix sidebar theme: same dark background fix as Audience CRM

---

GLOBAL KPI STYLING FIX (apply to ALL pages above):

The correct KPI card style (reference: Advertising page):
- Card background: slightly elevated from page background (e.g. bg-card or bg-secondary)
- Label: 11px, uppercase, letter-spacing, muted text color (e.g. text-muted-foreground)
- Value: 28px, font-weight 700, text-white — NO exceptions
- Icon (if present): text-primary or text-muted-foreground — never purple, teal, green, or any metric-specific color
- Trend: optional small text below value

Find the MetricsStrip or KPI card component used by the broken pages. The colored icons/values are likely caused by those pages passing a color prop or using a different component variant than Advertising uses. Make them all use the same component with the same default styling as Advertising.

---

DO NOT CHANGE:
- Advertising page (reference — already correct)
- Settings page (already correct)
- Any routing, data fetching, API calls, or business logic
- The actual content/functionality of any page

---
