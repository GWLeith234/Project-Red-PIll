Rework the Settings > Page Configuration tab (Navigation Manager) with full rename, reorganize, and drag-and-drop capabilities.

CURRENT STATE:
- Sections list shows section names with an edit (pencil) icon and page count badge
- Sections are draggable but rename may not be working correctly
- Sub-pages are shown below in a separate collapsed panel

TARGET STATE:

1. INLINE RENAME — SECTIONS:
- Clicking the pencil icon on any section row puts the section name into an inline text input directly in the row
- User types the new name and presses Enter or clicks a checkmark to save
- Pressing Escape cancels and restores the original name
- Saving calls PATCH /api/page-config/sections/:id with { name: newName }
- The sidebar navigation updates immediately to reflect the new name

2. INLINE RENAME — PAGES:
- Each page row within a section also has a pencil icon
- Same inline edit behavior: click pencil → input appears → Enter to save → Escape to cancel
- Saving calls PATCH /api/page-config/pages/:id with { title: newTitle }
- The sidebar navigation updates immediately to reflect the new page title

3. DRAG AND DROP — SECTIONS:
- Sections can be reordered by dragging the grip handle (⠿ icon, leftmost)
- Use HTML5 drag and drop, no external library
- On drop, update sort_order for all affected sections via PATCH /api/page-config/sections/reorder with { orderedIds: string[] }
- Visual feedback: dragged item shows reduced opacity, drop target shows a blue insertion line

4. DRAG AND DROP — PAGES WITHIN A SECTION:
- Pages within each section can be reordered by dragging their grip handle
- Pages can also be dragged FROM one section TO another section
- On drop within same section: update sort_order via PATCH /api/page-config/pages/reorder with { sectionId, orderedIds }
- On drop to different section: update parent section and sort_order via PATCH /api/page-config/pages/:id with { sectionId: newSectionId, sort_order: newOrder }
- Visual feedback: destination section highlights with a subtle border when a page is dragged over it

5. LAYOUT CHANGE:
- Show sections and their pages together in one unified list, not split into two separate panels
- Each section row is expandable/collapsible (chevron toggle)
- All sections start expanded by default
- Pages are indented under their section with a left border line connecting them visually
- Page rows show: grip handle, page icon, page title (editable), visibility toggle (eye icon), pencil icon
- Section rows show: grip handle, section icon, section name (editable), page count badge, pencil icon, delete icon

6. DELETE (already requested previously — ensure it works):
- Trash icon on section rows (appears on hover)
- Trash icon on page rows (appears on hover)  
- Confirmation dialog before deleting
- Cannot delete if section/page is_visible = true — show warning instead

7. SIDEBAR SYNC:
- Any rename or reorder change must immediately update the admin sidebar navigation without requiring a page refresh
- Use the existing sidebar data fetching mechanism — trigger a refetch after any successful save

Do not change Platform Settings or Theme tabs. Only modify the Page Configuration tab.
