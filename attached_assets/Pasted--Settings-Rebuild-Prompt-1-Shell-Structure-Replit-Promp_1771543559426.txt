# Settings Rebuild — Prompt 1: Shell Structure

## Replit Prompt — Copy and paste this entire block

```
Rebuild the Settings page shell with a new 5-tab structure. This prompt ONLY creates the tab structure and moves existing content into the correct tabs. Do not add any new functionality yet.

CONTEXT:
- The current Settings page has 3 tabs: Platform Settings, Theme, Page Configuration
- We are replacing this with 5 tabs: Branding, Integrations, AI Configuration, Platform Configuration, Live Site & App
- Everything currently in "Theme" moves into "Branding"
- Everything currently in "Page Configuration" (Navigation Manager) moves into "Platform Configuration"
- Everything currently in "Platform Settings" gets sorted into the correct new tab (see mapping below)
- The 3 new tabs (Integrations, AI Configuration, Live Site & App) get placeholder content for now

---

STEP 1 — UPDATE THE TAB STRUCTURE:

Replace the current 3 tabs with these 5 tabs in this order:

1. Branding
2. Integrations  
3. AI Configuration
4. Platform Configuration
5. Live Site & App

Use the same tab component/styling that currently exists. Just change the tab labels and content.

---

STEP 2 — BRANDING TAB:

Move ALL content from the current "Theme" tab into this tab exactly as-is. Do not change any Theme functionality — just relocate it under the Branding tab label.

Also move from "Platform Settings" into Branding (if these fields exist there):
- Platform name
- Platform tagline/description
- Logo URL
- Favicon URL
- Any other visual identity fields

Everything else in Platform Settings that is NOT visual identity stays where it is for now (we'll sort it in later prompts).

---

STEP 3 — PLATFORM CONFIGURATION TAB:

Move ALL content from the current "Page Configuration" tab (Navigation Manager — sections, subsections, drag and drop, add/delete) into this tab exactly as-is. Do not change any functionality — just relocate it.

---

STEP 4 — INTEGRATIONS TAB (placeholder):

Show a clean placeholder with:
- Section header: "Integrations"
- Subtitle: "Connect third-party services and platforms"
- A simple grid of integration category cards (no functionality yet, just visual):
  - Social Media (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube)
  - Podcast Distribution (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, RSS)
  - Email (SMTP, SendGrid)
  - SMS (Twilio)
  - Push Notifications (VAPID, Firebase)
  - Analytics (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel)
  - Storage (S3, Cloudflare R2)
  - Payment (Stripe)
- Each card shows: icon, category name, "Not configured" status badge in gray
- "Coming soon" feel — clean, professional, not broken-looking

---

STEP 5 — AI CONFIGURATION TAB (placeholder):

Show a clean placeholder with:
- Section header: "AI Configuration"
- Subtitle: "Manage AI behavior, content rules, and provider settings across the platform"
- Simple list of configuration categories with icons (no functionality yet):
  - AI Provider Settings
  - Content Generation Rules
  - Brand Voice & Tone
  - Auto-Generation Settings
  - Moderation Settings
  - Usage & Limits
- Each row shows the category name, a brief description, and a "Configure →" button that does nothing yet (disabled or shows "Coming soon" tooltip)

---

STEP 6 — LIVE SITE & APP TAB (placeholder):

Show a clean placeholder with:
- Section header: "Live Site & App"
- Subtitle: "Configure your audience-facing website and mobile app experience"
- Simple list of configuration categories:
  - Homepage Content
  - Navigation & Menus
  - PWA & Mobile App
  - Maintenance Mode
  - Cookie & Privacy
  - Ad Zones
- Same style as AI Configuration placeholder

---

STEP 7 — CLEANUP:

- Remove the old "Platform Settings", "Theme", and "Page Configuration" tab labels
- Make sure all existing functionality that was in those tabs still works — just under the new tab names
- Default active tab on page load: Branding
- Do not change any backend endpoints, database tables, or logic

---

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. /admin/settings loads with 5 tabs: Branding, Integrations, AI Configuration, Platform Configuration, Live Site & App
2. Branding tab shows the full Theme editor (colors, fonts, etc.) exactly as before
3. Platform Configuration tab shows the Navigation Manager exactly as before — sections, drag and drop, add/delete all still work
4. Integrations tab shows the category placeholder grid
5. AI Configuration tab shows the category placeholder list
6. Live Site & App tab shows the category placeholder list
7. No existing Settings functionality is broken
