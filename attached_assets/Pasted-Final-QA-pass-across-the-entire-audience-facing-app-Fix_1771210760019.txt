Final QA pass across the entire audience-facing app. Fix any remaining issues:

(1) Run a Lighthouse audit check. Make sure the PWA score is high by verifying: manifest.json has all required fields, service worker registers successfully, icons exist in all sizes, theme_color and background_color are set, start_url is valid, display is standalone.

(2) Check all audience pages load without console errors. Visit each route and fix any errors: /home, /podcasts, /news, /search, /read-later, and any /show/:id or /listen/:id/:id pages. Ignore Vite HMR websocket warnings — those are expected in dev mode.

(3) Fix the service worker cache error: "Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': Partial response (status code 206) is unsupported". In client/public/sw.js, update the fetch handler to skip caching responses with status 206 (partial content, which happens with audio/video streaming). In the cache.put sections, add a check: only cache if response.status === 200 (not 206 or other partial statuses). Change both cache.put calls to: if (response.ok && response.status === 200) { cache.put(request, response.clone()); }

(4) Verify the bottom tab bar navigation does NOT cause full page reloads. All tabs (Home, Listen, News, Search) should use client-side navigation via wouter. Test by adding a console.log in the tab click handler and confirming no "Navigated to" messages appear in the console.

(5) Verify the audio player persists across navigation. Play an episode, navigate to Home, confirm audio continues. The MiniPlayer bar should remain visible with working play/pause controls.

(6) Verify push notifications work end-to-end. The bell icon should show preferences when subscribed (no red dot). Publishing an article should deliver a notification.

(7) Verify bookmarks sync: save an article to Read Later as a subscribed user, check it appears in the database, clear localStorage, refresh, confirm it reappears.

(8) Remove any remaining console.log debug statements that were added during development (PUSH:, AUDIO_PROVIDER:, AUDIO CHECK: etc.). Keep error logging (console.error) but remove verbose debug logging.
