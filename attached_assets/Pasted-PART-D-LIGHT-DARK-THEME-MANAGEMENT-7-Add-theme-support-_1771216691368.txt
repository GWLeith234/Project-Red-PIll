PART D — LIGHT/DARK THEME MANAGEMENT:

(7) Add theme support to the platform. Add a theme_mode column to the branding table (or site_settings if that's where branding lives): text, default 'dark', options: 'light', 'dark', 'system'.

(8) Create client/src/hooks/use-theme.ts:
- Reads theme preference: first check localStorage for 'theme-preference', then fall back to branding setting from the API, then default to 'dark'
- If set to 'system', use window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)') to detect OS preference and listen for changes
- Applies the theme by adding/removing 'dark' class on document.documentElement (Tailwind dark mode strategy)
- Exports: { theme: 'light' | 'dark', setTheme: (mode: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system') => void, mode: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' }

(9) Create client/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx:
- A button that cycles through: Dark → Light → System
- Shows Moon icon for dark, Sun icon for light, Monitor icon for system
- Tooltip shows current mode name
- Saves preference to localStorage immediately

(10) Add the ThemeToggle to two places:
- Admin sidebar: at the bottom near the logout button
- Audience layout: in the hamburger menu or header area

(11) Ensure ALL admin and audience pages work correctly in both light and dark themes:
- Review all Tailwind classes across components. Anywhere colors are hardcoded (e.g., bg-gray-900, text-white, border-gray-800), add the appropriate dark: variant or use semantic Tailwind classes (bg-background, text-foreground, border-border) from shadcn/ui theme tokens
- PageHeader, MetricsStrip, DataCard, PipelineBoard, Leaderboard, SearchFilterBar, EmptyState — all must render correctly in both themes
- The audience site (home, news, podcasts, events, community, polls) must also support both themes
- Cards, tables, modals, and forms should all adapt

(12) Add a Theme section to Settings page (can be a new tab or within the existing Branding tab):
- Radio buttons for: Dark Mode, Light Mode, System (follow device)
- Preview panel showing how the admin dashboard looks in each theme
- Save button that updates the branding table AND localStorage
- This sets the default theme for all users. Individual users can override with the ThemeToggle button.
