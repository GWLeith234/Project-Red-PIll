Unify all Content section pages to share a consistent design pattern: PageHeader → Status Filters → MetricsStrip → Tool Section → Data Cards. Merge overlapping pages and ensure the same content lifecycle data flows through every view.

THE CORE PRINCIPLE: All content (articles, social posts, newsletters, clips, emails) lives in the content_pieces table with one unified status lifecycle:
draft → in_review → approved → scheduled → published (and rejected as a branch from in_review)

Every Content section page is a DIFFERENT VIEW of the same underlying data, not a separate silo.

PART A — UNIFIED STATUS SYSTEM:

(1) Standardize content_pieces.status to use exactly these values everywhere: "draft", "in_review", "approved", "scheduled", "published", "rejected". Update any existing content that uses "pending", "ready", "generating", "review", "suggested", or other statuses to map to the closest new status:
- "pending" → "in_review"
- "ready" → "approved"
- "generating" → "draft"
- "review" → "in_review"
- "suggested" → "draft"
- All others → "draft"

Run a migration/update query to normalize existing data.

(2) Add or ensure these columns exist on content_pieces:
- status: text, default 'draft' (using the statuses above)
- source: text, default 'manual' (manual, ai_generated, ai_assisted, podcast_pipeline)
- reviewer_notes: text, nullable
- scheduled_publish_at: timestamp, nullable
- submitted_for_review_at: timestamp, nullable
- assigned_to: text, nullable (user who is responsible for this piece)
- priority: text, default 'medium' (low, medium, high, urgent)

PART B — SHARED CONTENT COMPONENTS:

(3) Build a shared status filter bar component: client/src/components/admin/ContentStatusBar.tsx
- Horizontal row of clickable filter pills: All | Drafts | In Review | Approved | Scheduled | Published | Rejected
- Each shows a count badge with live data from a shared hook
- Active filter is highlighted with the status color
- Accepts onFilterChange callback and activeFilter prop
- This component is reused on Content Factory, Moderation Queue, and Kanban Board

(4) Build a shared content card component: client/src/components/admin/ContentCard.tsx
- Renders a single content piece consistently everywhere it appears
- Shows: status dot (colored) | type icon + label | title (bold, clickable) | author | date | priority badge | assigned user avatar
- Compact mode (for tables/lists) and expanded mode (for kanban cards)
- Actions dropdown: Edit, Preview, Submit for Review, Approve, Reject, Schedule, Publish, Delete (show only actions valid for current status)
- Clicking opens the Content Editor (shared editor — see Part C)

(5) Build a shared content metrics hook: client/src/hooks/use-content-metrics.ts
- Returns: { total, drafts, inReview, approved, scheduled, published, rejected, aiGenerated, publishedThisWeek }
- Used by MetricsStrip on every Content section page

PART C — UNIFIED CONTENT EDITOR (shared across all pages):

(6) Build client/src/components/admin/ContentEditor.tsx — a slide-out panel that opens from any Content page when creating or editing a piece:

LEFT SIDE (65% width):
- Title field (large input)
- Type selector: Article | Blog | Social Post | Email | Newsletter | Ad Copy | Clip
- Body editor (use existing ArticleEditor component or rich textarea)
- For social posts: character counter, platform preview (show how it looks on Twitter/Facebook/etc.)
- For emails: subject line field, preview text field, then body
- Collapsible SEO section: meta title, meta description, keywords
- Purple AI sparkle button with quick actions: Improve Writing, Make Shorter, Make Longer, Change Tone, Generate Headlines, SEO Check

RIGHT SIDE (35% width) — Sidebar:
- Status badge (large, colored, current status)
- Status history timeline (shows: created → submitted → approved → published with dates)
- Cover image upload (drag-and-drop)
- Platform selector (for social: which platforms to post to)
- Schedule toggle: "Publish now" vs "Schedule for later" with date/time picker
- Priority selector: Low | Medium | High | Urgent
- Assigned to: user dropdown
- Source badge: Manual | AI Generated | Podcast Pipeline
- Action buttons (stacked, full width):
  - Draft: "Submit for Review" (primary) + "Save Draft" (secondary)
  - In Review: "Approve" (green) + "Reject" (red, with feedback textarea that appears)
  - Approved: "Publish Now" (primary) + "Schedule" (secondary)
  - Scheduled: "Publish Now" + "Unschedule"
  - Published: "Unpublish" (returns to draft)
  - Rejected: Red callout showing reviewer_notes + "Edit & Resubmit"

This editor is used everywhere. Content Factory, Moderation Queue, Kanban — clicking any content piece opens this same editor.

PART D — CONTENT FACTORY REDESIGN:

(7) Rebuild Content Factory as the primary content hub — the "home page" for all content:

Layout:
- PageHeader: "Content Factory" + "+ Create" button + "AI Generate" purple button
- ContentStatusBar (the shared filter pills with counts)
- MetricsStrip: Total Pieces, Published This Week, AI Generated, Pending Review, Scheduled Queue, Avg. Days to Publish
- View toggle: Table View | Card Grid View (default to Table)
- Table View: sortable table of all content pieces using ContentCard compact mode. Columns: Status | Type | Title | Author | Priority | Date | Actions
- Card Grid View: responsive grid of ContentCard expanded mode
- Search bar + filters: type dropdown, author dropdown, date range, priority
- "+ Create" opens a type selector dropdown, creates a draft, opens ContentEditor
- "AI Generate" opens the AI Generate modal, creates a draft with AI content, opens ContentEditor

PART E — MODERATION QUEUE REDESIGN:

(8) Rebuild Moderation Queue as a focused review view — same data, filtered to in_review:

Layout:
- PageHeader: "Moderation Queue" + "Approve All" action (bulk approve visible items)
- ContentStatusBar (same component, but pre-filtered to "In Review" by default)
- MetricsStrip: Pending Review (count), Reviewed Today, Avg Review Time, Rejected Rate, Auto-Approved (if any), Oldest Pending
- Main area: list of content pieces with status "in_review", sorted by submitted_for_review_at (oldest first)
- Each item uses ContentCard with review-specific actions prominent: Approve (green check) and Reject (red X) buttons visible without opening a dropdown
- Clicking a card opens ContentEditor in review mode (approve/reject buttons in sidebar)
- After approving or rejecting, the card animates out and the next one slides up
- Add a side-by-side preview: left side shows the content as it will appear on the audience site, right side shows the ContentEditor

PART F — KANBAN BOARD REDESIGN:

(9) Rebuild Kanban Board to use the unified status columns instead of custom task columns:

Layout:
- PageHeader: "Kanban Board" + "+ Create" button
- MetricsStrip: same content metrics
- Board columns mapped to content lifecycle: Draft | In Review | Approved | Scheduled | Published
- Each column shows ContentCard in expanded mode
- Drag-and-drop between columns updates the content status via PATCH
- Drag rules (enforce valid transitions):
  - Can drag Draft → In Review
  - Can drag In Review → Approved or Rejected (show reject feedback prompt)
  - Can drag Approved → Scheduled or Published
  - Cannot skip steps (e.g., cannot drag Draft → Published directly)
- Column headers show count + total word count (for articles)
- Rejected items show in a collapsed "Rejected" row at the bottom

PART G — SCHEDULER REDESIGN:

(10) Rebuild Scheduler to focus on the calendar view of scheduled and published content:

Layout:
- PageHeader: "Scheduler" + "+ Schedule" button
- ContentStatusBar (pre-filtered to "scheduled" and "published")
- MetricsStrip: Scheduled This Week, Published This Week, Gaps (days with no content), Avg Posts/Day, Next Scheduled, Overdue
- Main area: Calendar view (month view default, with week view toggle)
  - Each day cell shows content pieces scheduled for that day as small colored pills (color by type)
  - Clicking a pill opens ContentEditor
  - Clicking an empty day opens "+ Create" with that date pre-filled in scheduled_publish_at
  - Drag pills between days to reschedule
- Below calendar: upcoming queue — list of next 10 scheduled pieces with countdown timers
- AI suggestion: "AI Suggest Schedule" button analyzes content and suggests optimal publish times based on audience engagement patterns

PART H — MY TASKS REDESIGN:

(11) Rebuild My Tasks as a personal filtered view:

Layout:
- PageHeader: "My Tasks" + "+ Create" button
- ContentStatusBar (pre-filtered to content assigned to the current user)
- MetricsStrip: My Drafts, My Pending Reviews, My Published This Week, Overdue Items
- Two views:
  - List view: content pieces where assigned_to = current user, sorted by priority then date
  - Calendar view: same as Scheduler but filtered to current user's assignments
- Each item uses ContentCard, clicking opens ContentEditor
- Quick actions: "Submit for Review" button directly on draft cards without opening editor

PART I — AI SITE EDITOR (keep separate but match design):

(12) AI Site Editor stays functionally separate (it's page building, not content creation) but should match the visual design pattern:
- PageHeader (already has it)
- MetricsStrip: Total Pages, Published Pages, Draft Pages, Last Updated
- Keep existing page builder functionality as the Tool Section
- Ensure it uses the same card styling, button patterns, and color system as the other Content pages

PART J — COMMUNITY (keep separate but match design):

(13) Community stays functionally separate but should match the design pattern:
- PageHeader (already has it)
- ContentStatusBar equivalent: Events | Polls | Discussion tab pills (same visual style as status filters)
- MetricsStrip (already has it)
- Ensure cards, tables, and forms match the same design as Content pages

PART K — AI GENERATE FLOW (end-to-end):

(14) When AI Generate creates content:
- Creates a content_pieces row with status: "draft", source: "ai_generated"
- Opens ContentEditor with AI content pre-filled
- User reviews, edits
- Clicks "Submit for Review" → status becomes "in_review", appears in Moderation Queue
- Reviewer approves → status becomes "approved"
- Publisher publishes or schedules → goes live

(15) When podcast pipeline generates content:
- Creates content_pieces rows with status: "in_review", source: "podcast_pipeline"
- These go directly to Moderation Queue (skip draft since they're auto-generated)
- Reviewer can approve, edit, or reject

(16) Wire the "AI Generate" button to be available on every Content page (Content Factory, Moderation Queue if reviewer wants to generate an alternative, Kanban, Scheduler). Same modal, same flow — always creates a draft and opens ContentEditor.
